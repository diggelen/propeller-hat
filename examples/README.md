The files you find here are complete examples from the Propeller HAT documentation.

To upload one to your Propeller HAT you must first compile it into a binary, like so:

```bash
openspin Diving-into-multicore.spin
```

Then you can load it with propman, like so:

```bash
propman Diving-into-multicore.binary
```
