#p1load

p1load has now been superseded by propman, which is installed by the Propeller IDE since version 0.30.0

There is therefore no reason for you to use p1load as an alternative. However, it is kept in this repository in case it could be useful to users who must stick to using an older version of the IDE

To use, simply run:

```bash
./install
```
then:

```bash
p1load binary_file.binary
```
