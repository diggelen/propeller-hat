Raspberry Pi Propeller HAT
==========================

The tools provided in this library are specifically designed
for the Raspberry Pi Propeller HAT and may require adaptation
to function with any other platforms.

The PropellerHAT library serves a dual purpose, as a Python
binary uploader for the Propeller and as a library which can
be imported into your Python modules to prepare the Propeller for
specific use-cases such as emulating an IO expander.
