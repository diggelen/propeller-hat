Propeller HAT, the 8-core microcontroller add-on for your Raspberry Pi.

###Features

* 8-core Parallax Microcontroller on-board
* 30 IO pins broken out, serial data/programming connection to Pi
* 20 Pi pins broken out for communications/ease of access
* 170pt breadboard for experimentation
* Python quick start library with PWM/Servo and GPIO libraries


###Getting started

For instant-gratification you can try the Propeller HAT IO libraries:

* [IO using Serial](documentation/Serial-IO.md)
* [IO using i2c](documentation/IO.md)
* [PWM for LEDs/Servos](documentation/PWM.md)

You'll need Propeller IDE to start programming your Propeller HAT:
